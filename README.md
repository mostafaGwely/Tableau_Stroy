[titanic data set](https://www.kaggle.com/wei10117/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster/data) is a data set that contains the information of the survivors and victoms of the sinking of the Titanic such that cabin code, name, # parents, # children and survived or not and so forth.

### In my project work

I analyzed multiple factors that could influence the survival rate of the passengers, including gender, class, and age. Based on the results, I found:

1-most ages are from `18` to `38` years

2-total number of male passenger is the double of the female passenger

3-the percentile of male survivors is smaller than those for not_survivors by almost `4.5%` but

4-the percentile of female survivors is larger than those for not_servivors by almost `4%`

5-the highest cabins for female survivors are `F33` and `E101` and for male survivors are `F2`, `E25`, `E24`, `C52`, and `B96 B98`

6-the class which has the highest rate for the male is the `3rd` class and for the female is the `first` class

# design

I used the colorblind palette in vizs like (blue and orange)

The final story consists of 5 slides:

- intro to the viz

- passenger distributions by age and sex

- survivors distributions by sex, cabins and by age and gender

- passengers distributions by sex and class using two kinds of plots `histograms` and `pie charts`

- survivors distributions by sex and class using two kinds of plots `histograms` and `pie charts`

# feedback

- what is the Pclass indicates?

- x-axis (age) ticks need to be consistency

- use colors so that it will be appropriate for colorblind people

- the third and forth dashboard inconsistent with their headers in the story
